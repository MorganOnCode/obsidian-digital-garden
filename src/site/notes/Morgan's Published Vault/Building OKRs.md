*Notes / Questions:* 
- what does [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/tactical consistency\|tactical consistency]] look like for this objective?
- what does 'showing up' look like? (minimum [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Tiny Habit recipe tool\|Tiny Habit recipe tool]])
- what triggers and behaviours should I map? ([[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Behaviour mapping\|Behaviour mapping]])
- what will I sacrifice or drop for this OKR?
- how can I tailor my [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/default activities\|default activities]] to move closer to this OKR? 
- what coaches, mentors and humans can help me with this? Who are you going to call? [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Make 3 phone calls, first\|first 3 people]] 
- how can I get into [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Flow State and Triggers\|Flow state]] with [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Flow State and Triggers Resources\|Flow State and Triggers Resources]] ?
- how can I [[game design\|game design]] systems - [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/gamification\|gamification]] + [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/game theory\|game theory]] ??
- what are my [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/leading indicators vs lagging indicators\|leading indicators vs lagging indicators]]? 

*Elon's process:* 
1. Question every part and specification 
2. Eliminate parts (add 10% back later)
3. Simplify and optimise
4. Accelerate cycle time
5. Automate 
*(never run this in reverse - never automate something that shouldn't exist)*

*Process & reflect on:*
1. outcome dependance - what does success look/feel like?
2. outcome independence - what does doing this in an infinite game look like? (its own reward)
	1. Journey & reps

*Consider:*
- What excites you the most? (If it feels fun, you’re more likely to do it.)
- What will have the biggest impact on your long-term success?
- What fits naturally into your existing skills and strengths?
