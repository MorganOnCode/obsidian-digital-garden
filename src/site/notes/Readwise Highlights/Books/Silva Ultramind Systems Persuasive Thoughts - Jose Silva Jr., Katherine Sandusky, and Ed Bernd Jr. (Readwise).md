Author:: [[Morgan's Brain/People/José Silva\|José Silva]] 

## Highlights
- Your Mental Screen will be upwards, and about 30 feet away from you. The Mental Screen is about 20 degrees above your horizontal level of sight, like when you are in a theater, and it can be all around you. ([Location 709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07LFLBPPH&location=709))

- You want your Mental Screen to be above the horizontal plane of sight. You want to physically turn your eyes up slightly. ([Location 711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07LFLBPPH&location=711))

- Why Turn the Eyes Up 20 Degrees? Why 20 degrees? Because it has been found that when you turn your eyes up 20 degrees relative to your face, you have a stronger production of alpha. Nobody knows why. It is believed that when the eyes were becoming evolved in your body, they were up before they were fully evolved.

- José Silva developed a technique to do those things. When you apply the technique correctly, the way he taught us to apply it, then the majority of your thoughts will be about the solution, not the problem. ([Location 817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07LFLBPPH&location=817))

- fact, we do away with the problem. He said that once you have a plan and you are working your plan, then it isn’t a “problem” anymore: It is a “project.” ([Location 818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07LFLBPPH&location=818))

- That is how we go beyond the problem to the solution. If it is a very big project, so big that it might take some time to accomplish, then concentrate on benchmarks along the way. ([Location 820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07LFLBPPH&location=820))

- Three Short Steps to Success After you learn to enter the alpha level, the most valuable tools you have are visualization and imagination. ([Location 829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07LFLBPPH&location=829))

- José Silva’s Three-Scenes Technique is a mental technique you can apply at the alpha level to identify and analyze the problem, ([Location 832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07LFLBPPH&location=832))

- The Three-Scenes Technique Go to your center with the 3 to 1 Method. ([Location 834](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07LFLBPPH&location=834))

- The 3 to 1 Method takes advantage of the conditioned responses that you developed in the Silva Centering Exercise. ([Location 835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07LFLBPPH&location=835))

- Here is how you do it: Find a comfortable position, close your eyes, take a deep breath, and mentally repeat and visualize the number 3, three times. You have already associated the number 3 with physical relaxation, so your body will relax when you do this. Take another deep breath and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number 2, three times. In the Silva Centering Exercise, you related the number 2 to mental relaxation. When you relax physically and mentally, your brain frequency will lower to the alpha level. Take another deep breath, and while exhaling mentally, repeat and visualize the number 1, three times, and you are at level 1, the alpha level, which is at the center of the brain frequency spectrum, and functions at the midbrain area, in the center of your brain. We will call this your center. ([Location 836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07LFLBPPH&location=836))
    - Note: 3 to 1 technique

- You can use the Three-Scenes Technique to program a glass of water so that it can be used for healing, or for other purposes. ([Location 922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07LFLBPPH&location=922))

- Get an ordinary water glass, fill it with water, and hold it with the fingers of both hands. Spread your fingers apart, and do not let the fingers of your right hand touch the fingers of your left hand. Energy from your right hand will flow through the water and be collected by the palm of your left hand. Enter your level and use the Three-Scenes Technique to program for whatever you need. ([Location 923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07LFLBPPH&location=923))

- Use Your Successes to Bring about More Success Go to alpha when you have succeeded. Go to alpha and strengthen the feeling of success, when you succeeded, the way you succeeded. ([Location 992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07LFLBPPH&location=992))
