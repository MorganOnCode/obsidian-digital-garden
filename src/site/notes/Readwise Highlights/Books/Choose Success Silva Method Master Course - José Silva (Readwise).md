## Highlights
- How much does it help to be able to use two brain hemispheres instead of just one? Imagine this: How it would be if most people thought that they could only use one leg. If everybody else hopped around on one leg, while you used two legs, you could get around much faster and easier than they could. ([Location 87](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=87))

- you can now learn to use both brain hemispheres to think with—you can learn to use more of your brain and mind than the average person so that you will have the ability to achieve great success also. ([Location 91](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=91))

- What does it take for you to be successful—with this course, and in life? First, you have to want it. You have to want to be successful. So let’s talk about your reasons for taking the course. ([Location 99](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=99))

- What do you want? How will it help you? Why is that important to you? To increase your desire, think of all the benefits you will derive. Who else will benefit? ([Location 103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=103))

- we are not here just to live it up, we’re not here for a seventy-year coffee break. We have a purpose, and that purpose is to solve problems, relieve suffering, and improve living conditions on the planet. ([Location 106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=106))

- Fives Steps to Success We’ll build towards outstanding success in five steps. Sort of like building a pyramid. ([Location 116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=116))

- The foundation—the base of our pyramid—is how you use your mind: Functioning at the alpha brain wave level. ([Location 117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=117))

- Positive thinking / attitude / belief systems. ([Location 118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=118))

- The second block in our pyramid is self-management. You will learn techniques to help you deal with problems like insomnia, tension and migraine headaches, poor memory, and bad habits. ([Location 119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=119))

- The third step deals with communications and decision making. You will learn strategies to obtain information and then use that information to make the best possible decisions. ([Location 124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=124))

- Step four puts your decisions into action. Once you have prepared yourself—prepared the vehicle, so to speak ([Location 125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=125))

- The most important key to using more of your mind is learning to function with conscious awareness at the alpha level. ([Location 138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=138))
    - **Note:** Alpha level

- alpha level is a level associated with relaxation and with light sleep at night. It is associated with daydreaming during the day. ([Location 141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=141))

- One thing we do is to use a positive thinking technique that we call Mental Housecleaning. ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=155))

- Here is what to do when you notice that you are using negative words and phrases: Stop, and cancel out the negative words by saying: “Cancel-cancel.” Then replace the negative words with positive words. ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=166))
    - **Note:** Cancel cancel

- It is very important to always finish with a positive statement, a positive thought. ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=168))

- Remember, when you are working on your projects, as long as you are making progress, you are moving in the correct direction. Keep going. Never give up. You cannot fail … unless you quit. If you are not getting positive feedback, then adjust your direction. But always keep going. ([Location 191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=191))
    - **Note:** Adjust course

- “Do you really want to be healed?” and I would add, “because my time is very valuable and I do not intend to waste it.” ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=226))
    - **Note:** What do yu really want?

- You will continue to strive to take part in constructive and creative activities to make this a better world to live in, so that when we move on, we shall have left behind a better world for those who follow. You will consider the whole of humanity, depending on their ages, as fathers or mothers, brothers or sisters, sons or daughters. You are a superior human being; you have greater understanding, compassion, and patience with others. ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=294))

- To make it easier for you to enter the alpha level the next time, he associates the main steps with numbers, ([Location 313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=313))

- Eyesight Is like a Switch You can “defocus” your vision and imagine being at alpha in order to function at the powerful alpha brain wave level, the ideal level of thinking and decision making. ([Location 337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=337))

- we’ll explain three formula-type techniques for your benefit. The formulas are in appendix C. ([Location 384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=384))

- you will learn later in this course to help you succeed: The Three Fingers Technique Visualization, imagination, and the Mirror of the Mind ([Location 494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=494))

- Dreams can provide various kinds of information. It can provide information that is stored on in your memory ([Location 567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=567))

- Your mind can bring you information from anywhere that information happens to be. Other people’s brain cells—their memory banks. From higher intelligence on the other side. From anywhere that information is stored. ([Location 569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=569))

- The Mental Screen allows you to transfer problems from the objective dimension to the subjective dimension so that you can correct them. ([Location 680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=680))

- Visualization is not like seeing. It is not even like dreaming. It is like remembering. It is remembering what something looks like. ([Location 693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=693))
    - **Note:** Manifest with visualising whats happened already. Bring the future to you

- Remembering what you have seen before is visualization. ([Location 698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=698))

- In order to imagine things and have them manifest in the physical world, your visualization and imagination must be at alpha. ([Location 703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=703))

- This is very important when you use a programming technique like the Mirror of the Mind, which you will learn a little later. It is important because you must first visualize the problem that you desire to correct, and then you must imagine the problem corrected; you must imagine your goal. ([Location 714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=714))

- To locate your Mental Screen, begin with your eyes closed, turned slightly upward from the horizontal plane of sight, at an angle of approximately 20 degrees. ([Location 728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=728))

- The area that you perceive with your mind is your Mental Screen. Without using your eyelids as screens, sense your Mental Screen to be out, away from your body. ([Location 729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=729))

- To improve the use of your Mental Screen, project images or mental pictures onto the screen, especially images having color. Concentrate on mentally sensing and visualizing true color. ([Location 730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=730))

- Do this with your eyes closed and turned slightly upward, and imagine the screen to be out and away from you. This is where you are going to detect and project mental images when you use visualization and imagination. ([Location 732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=732))

- The Mental Screen is to transfer from one dimension to the other, from one aspect to the other, where you are receiving or transmitting. It shows on your Mental Screen. So to transmit something, you project it onto your Mental Screen. To detect it, you sense it on your Mental Screen. To help you improve the use of your Mental Screen, which will help you to visualize and imagine better, we’ll learn a portion of a memory course. ([Location 734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=734))

- Mr. Silva got this memory peg system from a course by Bruno Furst. ([Location 737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=737))
    - **Note:** To read

- a more recent practitioner like Harry Lorayne, who uses the same system. ([Location 738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=738))
    - **Note:** To read

- Using visualization, imagination, association, and exaggeration makes it easier to remember things. ([Location 744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=744))

- We tend to remember things that we associate with having a good time. Most people can remember Christmas presents they got as children, or great birthday presents, or special events like their first date or their senior prom. ([Location 745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=745))

- I’ll provide the pegs for you to hang your mental pictures on. Later I’ll show you how to remember the pegs ([Location 750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=750))

- See how easy it is to remember a list of objects when you associate them with something familiar and make them memorable? ([Location 774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=774))

## New highlights added 2023-07-04 at 4:36 PM
- How to Remember the Peg Words ([Location 776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=776))

- This system is designed to make it as easy as possible to remember the first ten pegs. For instance, to convert the number 1 to a consonant, just put a top on the number 1, and you have a T. ([Location 777](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=777))

- Silva Three Fingers Technique. The Three Fingers Technique is a trigger mechanism that reminds you of something that you have programmed before. ([Location 820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=820))

- the Three Fingers Technique to help you relax in tense situations. ([Location 822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=822))
    - **Note:** Kat does this when stressed or getting worked up

- Here’s how to apply the Three Fingers Technique: Bring together the tips of the first two fingers and the thumb of either hand, in a circular form. Not the flat part of the fingers, the tips, the ends of your fingers. ([Location 828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=828))

- press the little finger into the palm of his hand. This is what happens naturally when you make a fist. It is also an easy position when you are firing a rifle: Your forefinger is on the trigger, and you can hold the tip of your little finger against the palm of your hand. ([Location 904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=904))
    - **Note:** You can build other triggers with mantra and NLP programming

- The Three Fingers Technique has become our Silva salute. Graduates all over the world may speak different languages, but they all understand the Three Fingers salute. ([Location 915](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=915))

- go to appendix C for the information to impress and program the Three Fingers Technique. ([Location 917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=917))
    - **Note:** Appendix c script

- Unleash Your Genius Mind: Visualization and Imagination ([Location 921](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=921))

- The Mirror of the Mind is one of the most used techniques in José Silva’s Choose Success Master Course. It is used for correcting problems and achieving goals. ([Location 922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=922))
    - **Note:** Mirror of the minf technique

- The Mirror of the Mind uses visualization and imagination, two faculties of genius. ([Location 924](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=924))

- To use the Mirror of the Mind, here’s what you do: While at your level, create and project on your Mental Screen a full-length mirror. This mirror will be known as the Mirror of the Mind. This Mirror of the Mind can be mentally increased in size to encompass within its frame a thing or things, a person or persons, a small scene or a large scene. ([Location 925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=925))

- The color of the frame of the Mirror of the Mind can be mentally changed from blue to white. The blue frame will denote the problem or the existing situation, which can be converted into a project. The white frame will denote the solution or goal. ([Location 929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=929))
    - **Note:** Blue frame is a challenge. White is a solution.

- To solve a problem or to reach a goal with the Mirror of the Mind, enter level 1 with the 3 to 1 Method, then project the image of the Mirror of the Mind with blue frame on your Mental Screen. ([Location 931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=931))
    - **Note:** 3 to 1 method. Mental screen method. Mirror of the mind method.

- Create an image of the problem thing, person, or scene and project it on your blue-framed Mirror of the Mind in order to make a good study of the problem. After making a good study of the problem, erase the problem image, move the mirror to your left, change the mirror’s frame to white, and create and project a solution image onto the white-framed mirror. From then on, any time you happen to think of the project, visualize the solution image you have created, framed in white. And this is so. ([Location 932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=932))

- For instance: If you have a health problem, visualize it in the blue-framed mirror; then in the white-framed mirror, imagine yourself in perfect health. From then on, whenever you happen to think of your health condition, recall the solution image you have created, framed in white. ([Location 944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=944))

- If you have something that you must learn, such as a test you must take or a new skill you need to develop, then in the blue-framed mirror, visualize yourself studying to learn it. In the white-framed mirror, imagine the test with a perfect score, or imagine yourself doing the new task correctly. ([Location 946](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=946))

- If you want a promotion, in the blue-framed mirror, visualize yourself in your present position, and in the white-framed mirror, create a mental picture of yourself in your new job. ([Location 951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=951))

- Why the Future Is to the Left You might be wondering why we instruct you to move the mirror to the left. During his age regression and progression research with children, Mr. Silva found that they were detecting the images of the past towards their right and images of the future to their left. So he incorporated that into the programming. ([Location 957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=957))
    - **Note:** Which direction do you think of past and future? Left vs right.

- we do not just program for something that we want. We program to solve a problem. ([Location 962](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=962))

- Suppose you want to win a trophy in a golf tournament. You can program for that with the Mirror of the Mind. In the blue-framed mirror, picture yourself playing in the tournament. In the white-framed mirror, imagine yourself getting the trophy. ([Location 998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=998))

- Remember to get your body involved: swing some golf clubs and correct your mistakes so you will continue getting better and better. ([Location 1000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=1000))
    - **Note:** When programming yourself, move your body and FEEL the vision manifest

- If you want to be more assertive, first visualize yourself in the blue-framed mirror, backing down and not standing up for your rights or your beliefs. Then in the white-framed mirror, imagine yourself being assertive, standing up for your rights or your beliefs, and imagine people responding positively to you. ([Location 1007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=1007))

- Always remember that after you program a project for the first time, then whenever you happen to think of the project, visualize the solution image you have created framed in white. Do this any time you happen to think of the project—while programming, while working, while driving. ([Location 1010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=1010))

- You do not want to add energy to the problem, so you do not go back to the blue-framed mirror. When you think of your situation, immediately visualize the solution image you have created, framed in white. ([Location 1012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=1012))
    - **Note:** Solution or outcome is always anchored in a white frame, correct this if you mistake for blue.

- Get Your Feelings Involved Also remember to get your feelings involved. The primary language is visual, and you can add a lot of power to your programming by getting your feelings involved. This is a good way to increase your desire, and the more desire you have, the greater your chances of success. ([Location 1015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=1015))
    - **Note:** How will you feel? where will you be? feel, smell, taste success!

- How to Deal with Fear, Guilt, and Doubt ([Location 1050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=1050))

- Mirror of the Mind. You can use it to overcome irrational fear, guilt, and doubt: Irrational fear, guilt about mistakes you may have made, and doubt about your abilities and your value as a human being. ([Location 1051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=1051))

- There are three steps: Remove obstacles by neutralizing old traumas. 2  Program at level. Create a blueprint for success. Action in the physical world: do that which you fear. ([Location 1053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=1053))
    - **Note:** Three step fear setting

- The Theta Brain Wave Level Helps The theta brain wave level, from 4 to 7 cycles per second, is where we functioned when we were children, from four to seven years old. It is also associated with our survival mechanism. ([Location 1058](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=1058))

- How to Neutralize Negative Past Programming When you desire to program to neutralize a limiting belief system, proceed in the following manner: Enter your level, and use the Mirror of the Mind. Visualize your problem in the blue framed-mirror directly in front of you. What is the problem? ([Location 1069](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=1069))
    - **Note:** Use this to overcome fear beliefs from fear setting

- You do not need to figure out why you have the problem. Just figure out what the problem is. Make a good study of it; notice the details. Perhaps you lose your concentration as you near your quota. Maybe you have more errands to run than usual. Maybe you say the wrong thing when asking for appointments. Study the situation, and notice the details. ([Location 1075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=1075))

- After you have made a good study of the problem, erase the problem, move the mirror towards your left, change the frame to white, and create and project the solution image onto the white-framed mirror. ([Location 1078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=1078))

- When you do this, you are giving instructions to your mind to find the cause of the problem and correct it. ([Location 1080](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=1080))

- When You Do It Yourself, the Change Is Permanent The key is to you enter your level on your own, not guided by somebody else. Once at your level, you program yourself. When someone else programs you, results are usually only temporary. When you program yourself, results are usually permanent. ([Location 1084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=1084))

- José Silva always teaches. Learn to enter the alpha level. Establish a deep level, and learn how to stay there and function there. Do your thinking at alpha. Analyze problems there. There is more information available to you at alpha than at beta, and when you have enough information, it is easy to correct the problem. Mr. Silva says that if you have a problem to work on, find five other people with the same problem, and program for them. If you want to imagine yourself confident, find five other people who also want to be more confident, and program for them. In the white-framed mirror, picture them functioning in a confident manner. That image will also help you to be more confident. It is easier for most people to believe that somebody else can achieve the goal than that they themselves can. So program confidently for those five people as well as for yourself, and you will multiply your results many times over. ([Location 1148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=1148))

- Mental Rehearsal for Better Performance ([Location 1336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=1336))

- The Silva Mental Rehearsal Technique is for practicing skills mentally so that you can perform them better physically. ([Location 1338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=1338))

- You have learned how to enter the powerful alpha brain wave level with conscious awareness, and how to activate your mind while remaining at the alpha level so that you can program yourself for success. ([Location 1728](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09Q3RS9KM&location=1728))
    - **Note:** Enter alpha state and go to a level deeper than you are presently

- You learned how powerful positive thinking is. You also learned practical techniques to help you actually practice positive thinking and maintain a positive mental attitude regardless of what’s going on around you.
