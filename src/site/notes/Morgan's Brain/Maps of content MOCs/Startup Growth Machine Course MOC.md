# Process Summary
![Startup 4 core strengths.png|800](/img/user/Attachments/Startup%204%20core%20strengths.png)

1. Mindset: 'discovery' not 'iterative' - your goal is finding growth levers that scale
2. **[[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Startup Growth Machine Course - Metrics (north stars and key drivers)#Growth model\|Growth map entire funnel]]** - visually see flow of people
3. **Identify [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Startup Growth Machine Course - Language Market Fit\|Language Market Fit]]** 
	1. Interview your customers - [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Jobs to be done canvas - Matt Lerner\|jobs to be done interviews]] 
	2. Identify forces at play (push/pull)
	3. "looks like food"
4. **Identify [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Startup Growth Machine Course - Metrics (north stars and key drivers)\|Metrics]]**
	1. [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Startup Growth Machine Course - Metrics (north stars and key drivers)#Selecting North Star Metrics\|Selecting Metrics]] - What is worth measuring?
	2. [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Startup Growth Machine Course - Metrics (north stars and key drivers)#Identifying Key Drivers\|Identifying Key Drivers]] - select 1-3 key drivers to manage
	3. [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Startup Growth Machine Course - Metrics (north stars and key drivers)#Rate limiting Step\|Rate limiting steps]] - what are the blockers to growth?
5. **[[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Startup Growth Machine Course - Growth Sprints\|Craft Growth Sprints]]**
	1. Design discovery experiments to test on a weekly+ basis 
	2. (Matt's video on scoring & prioritising ideas)
	3. Prioritise which experiments will make the largest impact & learnings
