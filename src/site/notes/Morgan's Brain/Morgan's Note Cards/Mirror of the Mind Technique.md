up:: [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/The Silva Method\|Silva Method]], [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/alpha state\|Alpha State]] 
### Steps
1. Enter [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/alpha state\|alpha]] with the [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Three scenes technique\|Silva 3 to 1 Method]] 
2. Create and project on your [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Mental Screen Method\|mental screen]]: 
	1. a *full-length mirror with a thick frame.* 
3. A ==blue==, textured frame = problems, challenges, pains, fears 
4. A ==white==, smooth frame = solutions, outcomes, strategy, actions and results

This is an [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP)\|NLP]] programming technique, for correcting a problem. 
You should [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/visualisation\|visualise]] the situation and imagine the future outcome, to manifest what will occur. 

To move a ==white frame (solution)== *into the future*, move it from the left, to the right.
