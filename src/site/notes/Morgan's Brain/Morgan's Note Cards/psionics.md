> [!gpt]- Summary Intro to Psionic Abilities 
> source:: [Preview of Psionic Abilities Overview Part 1 with Capt Randy Cramer - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UlzV6rpZMY)
> Introduction to Psionics:
> 
> - Fundamental basis requires developing brain-body clarity (being grounded, centered, shielded)
> - Psionics defined as the ability to bend matter and energy to one's will
> - Includes perception of matter/energy beyond the five normal senses
> - Requires diligent practice to develop clarity for affecting internal/external perceptions
> 
> Categories of Psionic Abilities:
> 
> - Divided into "soft" and "hard" abilities
> - Soft abilities: No immediate tangible effect; involves perception, understanding, reading, influencing
> - Hard abilities: Produce immediate tangible changes/impacts (e.g., telekinesis)
> - Skills are interconnected - practicing one helps develop others
> - Skills often follow "skill trees" with prerequisite abilities
> 
> Teaching Methods Discussion:
> 
> - Traditional seminar model criticized for low success rate (~1%)
> - Online course model preferred for better follow-through and student support
> - Emphasis on multiple teaching methods to accommodate different learning styles
> - Focus on practical, repeatable results rather than just theoretical knowledge
> - Importance of ongoing support and practice versus one-time demonstrations
> 
> Specific Psionic Abilities Covered:
> 
> - Previously covered: Remote viewing, precognition, dowsing, animal communication, telepathy, self-healing
> - Telekinesis: Moving energy, initially practiced using hands
> - Pyrokinesis: Speeding up molecules to create heat
> - Cryokinesis: Slowing down molecules to create cold
> - Weather control: Combination of temperature and pressure manipulation
> - Advanced applications include cloud manipulation and levitation
> 
> Training Methods:
> 
> - Use of specific training devices (e.g., TK trainer, PK trainer)
> - Scientific measurement of results (using precise thermometers)
> - Starting with small, measurable effects before progressing to larger ones
> - Importance of rational belief versus over-belief
> - Focus on provable, repeatable, verifiable results
>
