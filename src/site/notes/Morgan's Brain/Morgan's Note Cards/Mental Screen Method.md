[[Morgan's Brain/People/Andrew Huberman\|Andrew Huberman]] talks about this in his [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/fire breath - Andrew Huberman\|look up and breathe deeply and sniff twice to inflate lung sacks]] technique.

Your mental screen is like wearing VR glasses. 
It's all around you, 360 degrees. 

Your mental screen allows you to both transmit and receive information from different dimensions, from different energy frequencies. (like on psychedelics) 

Use: *imagination to project* and *[[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/visualisation\|visualisation]] to receive.*


#### Technique

With your eyes closed, imagine a huge cinema screen outwards and before you. 
To transmit something, project it on your mental screen.

The more you can [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/visualisation\|visualise]], associate ([[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Linking your thinking method\|LYT]]), and exaggerate, the stronger and more anchored your mental screen visualisation will be. 

**Steps to Practice the Mental Screen Technique:**

1. *Relaxation*: The first step involves reaching a relaxed state of mind - [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/alpha state\|Alpha State]] 
	1. (see techniques like: [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Three scenes technique\|count down from 3]])
	2. 10 days consecutively, allowing yourself to gradually relax with each count.

2. *Projection*: Once you've reached your relaxed state, start projecting your imagination towards ==your mental screen==. This could involve visualising a goal, a scenario, or a person, depending on the objective.

3. *Visualization*: Following the projection phase, the next step is to visualize receiving what you've projected. This visualisation process is key to manifesting your goals or achieving your desired outcomes.

4. *Positive Affirmation*: After the visualisation step, consolidate and amplify your expectation of achieving your desired outcomes using positive affirmations.

Remember, as with any other mental practice or technique, consistent practice is key to mastering the Mental Screen Technique.
