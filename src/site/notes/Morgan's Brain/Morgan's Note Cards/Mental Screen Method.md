[[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/eyes up to 20 degrees to access alpha state\|eyes up to 20 degrees to access alpha state]] 

[[Morgan's Brain/People/Andrew Huberman\|Andrew Huberman]] talks about this in his [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/fire breath - Andrew Huberman\|look up and breathe deeply and sniff twice to inflate lung sacks]] technique.

Your mental screen is like wearing VR glasses. 
It's all around you, 360 degrees. 

Your mental screen allows you to both transmit and receive information from different dimensions, from different energy frequencies. (like on psychedelics) 

Use: *imagination to project* and *[[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/visualisation\|visualisation]] to receive.*


#### Technique

With your eyes closed, imagine a huge cinema screen outwards and before you. 
To transmit something, project it on your mental screen.

The more you can [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/visualisation\|visualise]], associate ([[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Linking your thinking method\|LYT]]), and exaggerate, the stronger and more anchored your mental screen visualisation will be. 

**Steps to Practice the Mental Screen Technique:**

1. *Relaxation*: The first step involves reaching a relaxed state of mind - [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/alpha state\|Alpha State]] 
	1. (see techniques like: [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Three scenes technique\|count down from 3]])
	2. 10 days consecutively, allowing yourself to gradually relax with each count.

2. *Projection*: Once you've reached your relaxed state, start projecting your imagination towards ==your mental screen==. This could involve visualising a goal, a scenario, or a person, depending on the objective.

3. *Visualization*: Following the projection phase, the next step is to visualize receiving what you've projected. This visualisation process is key to manifesting your goals or achieving your desired outcomes.

4. *Positive Affirmation*: After the visualisation step, consolidate and amplify your expectation of achieving your desired outcomes using positive affirmations.

Remember, as with any other mental practice or technique, consistent practice is key to mastering the Mental Screen Technique.

I pictured a grand house with tall, manicured trees lining a long drive up to its double front doors. This is the house of a successful millionaire. I felt the veg/herb garden to the left of the house, through a hedgerow archway and a luxury swimming pool to the right side. </br> I felt myself enter the house, and saw a sweeping staircase up to the bedrooms and first floor. A large entertaining living room on the left, and a huge working space/office with multiple desk setups (treadmill desk, standing desk, central bureau for meetings). It felt like home, with success and peace. It felt real.</li><li>#on/EveningReview I tried adding the [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Mirror of the Mind Technique\|Mirror of the Mind Technique]] - I saw the blue mirror as a jagged, ice covered frame, like the ice dragon wings of [Tōshirō Hitsugaya](https://bleach.fandom.com/wiki/T%C5%8Dshir%C5%8D_Hitsugaya)'s bankai; [Hyōrinmaru](https://bleach.fandom.com/wiki/Hy%C5%8Drinmaru_(Zanpakut%C5%8D_spirit)). I saw my dissatisfied feelings towards [[Input Output MOC\\|IOG]], Tim and the state of my career at that company. </br> I then moved/swiped the frame to the left, and brought in a crystal white frame from the right of my [[Mental Screen Method\\|mental screen]], I saw myself strong, smiling and confident, but the image faded.
