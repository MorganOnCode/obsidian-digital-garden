[[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Average knowledge workers\|Average knowledge workers]] find this harder, as the game is more mental than physical 
## üñê 5 tactics to ENGAGE! üöÄ:
 
**1. Start easy ([[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/easy to do, easy not to do\|easy to do, easy not to do]])**
- [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/the hardest part is starting\|the hardest part is starting]]
- [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/write or the blank page\|write or the blank page]]
- [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/I say. We do.\|I say. We do.]] - set your mind to an easy, achievable task.

- [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Fear Setting (Process)\|fear setting]] - Move on from these fears, turn them around in your favour.

**3. Rewards**
- Use [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/caffeine\|caffeine]] to reward engagement and passing through struggle.
- Set small milestones or triggers for rewards.
	- eg. Dark chocolate or keto treats for completing XX amount of work
- set [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Pomodoro Technique\|pomodoro timers]] and pre-define *refreshing* [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Pomodoro breaks\|pomo breaks]] (breaks should not be more stimulating than the task)
 
**4. Start Moving**
- get your blood flowing to move the struggle chemicals around. Move adrenaline, move cortisol.
- Stand up desk
- air squats during breaks
 
**5. Create pressure (stakes)**
- [[Stikk\|Stikk]]
- openly tell people what you're doing, get them to be your referee 
- Get an accountability partner. Burn the boats. Give yourself no way out.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ The Release Phase: üëê 
 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




> [!question]- what is *release*?
> The point at which you stop actively focusing on the problem or task, allowing yourself to ‚Äú*let go*‚Äù. 
> The subconscious mind is making connections and processing information more efficiently, organising the information you struggled with.
> 
> The ==release phase is important== because it allows your brain to shift from the high-stress mode (fueled by [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Cortisol\|cortisol]] and [[adrenaline\|adrenaline]]) into a more relaxed state, typically facilitated by chemicals like [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Nitric Oxide\|nitric oxide]], which helps reduce [[stress\|stress]] levels. 
> 

When you reach a point of focus and ease, [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Nitric Oxide\|Nitric Oxide]] is released and flushes out stress hormones.
Nitric Oxide also produces [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Serotonin\|serotonin]] and [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Dopamine\|dopamine]] and reduces [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/eustress is better than distress\|stress]] 

==Using the [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Pomodoro Technique\|Pomodoro Technique]], you **cycle between**:== **[[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/What is Flow?\|flow]] and [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Release Phase\|release]]**

- ! Short [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Pomodoro breaks\|pomo breaks]] ==are== release phase (*recovery*) during the working period. 

This calming, resting state of the brain is characterised by [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/alpha state\|alpha brain waves]].

**We prepare to enter the next [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/What is Flow?\|flow state]]** 

## How to reach release before flow:
- listen to soothing music 
- listen to hard moving music 
- gain [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/clarity\|clarity]] through persisting in the [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Struggle Phase\|struggle of getting to flow]] 
- persist (worth saying again) 
- just start.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Flow: üåä

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




> The transition into flow comes quite quickly after the [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Release Phase\|release is felt]]

==Flow is where the level of challenge, meets the level of skill.==
## Flow traits:
- Thinking and operating becomes subconscious and automated.
- Intense and focused concentration on the present.
- Merging of action and awareness.
- Loss of reflective self-consciousness.
- Sense of personal control.
- Distortion of temporal experience.
- Activity becomes intrinsically motivating.

To **increase awareness** of *flow states*: 
- Build somatic (inner body) awareness of this state and notice the stages
- Find activities (sports, working out) that put you in flow and attach triggers when you're there (music, touch, phrases)
 
- @ The '*flow channel*' is a beautiful zone where the challenge of the activity is high enough to be engaging (not boring) and the skills level required is just right:

## Conditions for flow
1. Knowing ==what to do next== - [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/clarity\|clarity]]
2. Knowing *how to do it* - [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/ability chain\|ability chain]] 
3. Freedom from [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Distraction MOC\|distractions]] 
4. Clear and immediate feedback - [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/self mentorship\|mentor yourself]], [[coaching\|coaching]], [[speak to customers\|speak to customers]]  
5. Navigate **flow channel** from low -> highly perceived *challenges* & *skills* - [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/challenge-to-skill balance\|challenge-to-skill balance]]
## Find your '**Flow Channel**'

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




The **balance** of ==challenge== and ==ability/skill== leads to different emotions arising:

## Ways to regulate the challenge-skills balance:
 1. Define the ==scope== üõ†Ô∏è=> [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/clarity\|get clear]] 
 2. *Lower the hurdle* üöß => [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Tiny Habit recipe tool\|make tiny]]
 3. Regulate **time** ‚è±Ô∏è => [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Parkinson's law\|Parko's Law - allocate time guesstimates]] 

You can make things more engaging/ *challenging*/ thrilling by: 
**applying time pressure** ([[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Parkinson's law\|Parkinson's law]]) and giving yourself *more or less time* to get tasks done: 

 1. *Something boring?* - **compress time** (eg. 2x Pomos) - increases challenge & make fun.
 2. *Something unknown and challenging?* - **give more time** - release some of the challenge. 



</div></div>


You can constrain timelines ([[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Parkinson's law\|Parkinson's law]]) and break tasks into their smallest parts [[Morgan's Brain/Maps of content MOCs/Tiny Habits and Behaviour Design MOC ‚ôªÔ∏è\|Tiny Habits MOC]]

You want to clear [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Allostatic Load\|Allostatic Load]] actively.
You want your [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/parasympathetic nervous system\|parasympathetic nervous system]] to reset you. 

Ensure you replenish key neuro-chemicals used during working hours with recovery. 

Consolidate your mental RAM. and reduce [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/cognitive load\|cognitive load]] with [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Pomodoro breaks\|recovery breaks]] that nourish without over-stimulating promote recovery. 

==You want active recovery==
You want to clear stress (physical and mental) and be in [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Law of state transfer\|state]] ready to execute. 

> Recovery is part of the work process.

Choose your [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/default activities\|default activities]] carefully, and for the most nourishment and growth. 
- have fun
- spend time with loved ones
- talk about what you've done and what you're learning
 
[[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/avoid the static\|avoid the static]]
This is the stage you need to [[avoid junk inputs\|avoid junk inputs]] (TV, social media etc.) entirely. 
Abstinence is the best policy with junk content. 

## Measuring recovery
Define what each 'work' and 'recovery' block looks like and how you focus best. 

Two litmus tests for assessing an effective active recovery protocol:
1. **Objective**: Increasing [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Heart Rate Variability (HRV)\|Heart Rate Variability (HRV)]] over time of doing the active recovery.
2. **Subjective**: Feeling of a "mini vacation" reset - you're ready to execute again. 

[[Morgan's Brain/People/Tim Ferriss\|Tim Ferriss]] talks about taking 'mini-retirements' to rest, recover and prepare for the next sprint. 

Stack recovery protocols for enhanced effects. 
- Sauna AND ice bath. 
- time-in-nature AND meditation.
- Reading AND journalling. 

## Activities for recovery 
==Active recovery:== [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Pomodoro breaks\|Pomodoro breaks]]

# Brain Chemistry: üß™ 
 
Our brains are the same as cavemen.
Your survival chemicals and instincts are at play 24/7.
You need to be aware of the mismatch between your physiology and the modern world's high-paced temptations.

Your brain is neuroplastic.
Your brain can build itself with practice and etching neural pathways.
- you need to refresh your learning!

[[Morgan's Brain/Maps of content MOCs/Supplements MOC üíä\|Supplements MOC üíä]] 
 
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ üß™ Dopamine:
[[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Dopamine\|Dopamine]]
- The reward chemical. "Do it again!"
- Think: cocaine for the brain.
Dopamine release when working or learning will build habits and consistency.
Dopamine gives drive and excitement.
High Dopamine levels feels like a 'motivation' state.
 
Break goals into the smallest possible tasks to trigger dopamine.
Prepare and give yourself little treats when you succeed.
(effort, not outcome!)

[[Tiny Habit Celebrations.png]] will help amplify dopamine after completing a task/win.
 
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ üß™ Noradrenaline:

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




*aka Norepinephrine*
- The urgency chemical. "Do it now!"
- Think: fear of loss.
Combined with Cortisol, this feels like stress and cognitive strain.
Combined with Dopamine, this feels like alert focus.
 
Setting short deadlines (Parkinson's law) will stimulate Noradrenaline
Cold and ice bath therapy will stimulate
 
Supplements:
- L-Tyrosine
- Phenylalanine
- Curcumin (Turmeric)

</div></div>
 
 
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ üß™ Serotonin:

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




- The 'winning' chemical.
- The feel good reward.
 
Sunlight and vitamin-D can boost serotonin
- L-Typtophan
- Protein and low-carb will help
- 5-HTP (in small doses)

</div></div>


 
### 4Ô∏è‚É£üß™ Endorphines:

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




- The exercise and release chemical.
- Feel good for stressing and pushing limits.
Endorphines relese pain
 
Release Endorphins:
- Exercise.
- Intermittent fasting / time restricted eating.
- Laughter
- Massages and sex

</div></div>


 
### 5Ô∏è‚É£üß™ Nitric Oxide:

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




- The 'flow' chemical
- moves from 'struggle' to 'flow'
 
Produce more Nitric Oxide:
- Exercise
- Nitrate rich foods (beets, spinach, cacao, seeds)
 
Supplements:
- L-citruline
- L-Arginine
- Grape seed extract
- Resveratrol
- Q10
 
Measure:
- Nitric Oxide testing strips

</div></div>
 
 
### 6Ô∏è‚É£üß™ BDNF (Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor)

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




- Growth hormone for the brain
- Enhances learning, blood<>brain barrier absorption and neural pathways.
- Neurogenesis (growing more brain cells)
 
For new skill acquisition, you need BDNF high.
BDNF is low in dark/winter seasons (SAD)
 
Produce more BDNF:
- Exercise
- Sunlight and Vit-D
- Intermittent / time restricted eating
- Green-tea and Curcumin (Turmeric)

</div></div>
 

 
### 7Ô∏è‚É£üß™ Cortisol:

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




- The 'stress' hormone
- You want to reduce cortisol and inflammation (insulin)
Released for fight/flight mode.
Felt most during the 'struggle' phase of flow (see below)
 
Reduce Cortisol:
- Avoid negativity or negative framing (21-day no complaint challenge)
- Meditate
- HRV
- Vitamin-D and natural sunlight
- Moderate caffeine (200mg max)
- Optimise sleep
- Get a massage / have sex

# Tactics

### üéì Learning and Practice:
 [[Morgan's Brain/Maps of content MOCs/Learning how to learn MOC\|Learning how to learn MOC]]
 [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/things I want to learn - list\|things I want to learn - list]]  
Your brain operates best when practice is spaced out.
eg. learning the guitar is best when done in 1hr increments with rest and consolidation phases in between (see: 'phases of flow' below)
 
üçÖ [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Pomodoro Technique\|Pomodoro Technique]] is excellent for this! üçÖ
### üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Priming:
[[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Priming\|Priming]] 
You can select what you're consciously thinking about and how you're framing problems by 'priming' for situations.
eg.
If you're told to think of 'food', then to solve this word problem:
"SO _ P"
You'll probably think of the word: "SOUP"
But, if you're told to think of 'cleaning':
You'll probably think of the word: "SOAP"

### üíï Heart Resonance and State:
You can prime for learning and action by making sure you're physiologically in the best state possible.
Training [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Heart Rate Variability (HRV)\|HRV]] and somatic (intuitive) heart resonance will give you the best opportunity for learning and getting through struggles.

[[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Growth Mindset\|Growth Mindset]]
- Growth vs fixed mindset
- Giving rewards for effort and commitment to the process is much healthier than rewarding 'skill' or outcomes!
- Be [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/outcome dependence\|outcome independent]]
 
### üê∂ Conditioning and Triggers:
Think: Pavlov's dog
- [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/you are the average of the five people you associate with most\|you are the average of the five people you associate with most]] - choose who you spend time with.
- if your friends are negative, you'll be negative. And vice versa.
- Aim to be the least skilled in a group, learn and give value.
 
### üìù Memory:
- Memory is best stored when it's in spacial and temporal awareness (eg. Palace technique)
- Repetition alone is not going to be effective.
- Working memory is your RAM and can be easily overloaded.
- 'Being present' is the best way to access your working memory
- Distractions destroy your working memory. We spend 11 mins of focus for every 25 mins of work.
- Write everything down to avoid distractions (have a logbook)
 
### üí¢ Emotional Memory:
eg. if having a near drowning experience (Tim Ferriss) you won't want to ever learn to swim.
Vice Versa:
- if memory is attached to strong arousal emotions, we attach more meaning to it.
- Try to add emotion to any learning to make it more relevant and a more automated action.
 
### „Äú Brain Waves:
[[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Brain wave frequencies and states\|brain waves]] 
- Alpha, Beta, Delta and Theta states
- Consume L-Theanine to improve
- Practice HRV resonance

## üïî Section 3: Flow Triggers:

[[Flow-Trigger-Cheat-Sheet.pdf]]
[[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Flow State and Triggers Resources\|Flow State and Triggers Resources]] 

![flow trigger cheatsheet.png](/img/user/Attachments/flow%20trigger%20cheatsheet.png)
[22 Flow Triggers: The Ultimate Peak Performance Toolkit For Hacking Flow](https://www.raizasali.com/post/flow-triggers-for-hacking-flow)

### üß† Trigger 1: Intensely Focused Action
 [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/action is a skill\|action is a skill]] => [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/action begets action\|action begets action]] => [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/inaction is a slow death\|inaction is a slow death]]

1. [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/single tasking\|single tasking]] Single focus.
2. [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/11-to-25 rule\|11-to-25 rule]] - every dopamine distraction, costs 25 mins of life
3. [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Parkinson's law\|Parkinson's law]] (restrict the window for success) - enforce deadlines

### üß† Trigger 2: Clear Goals

[[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/clarity\|get clarity]]
We release [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Dopamine\|dopamine]] when: 
1. we 'set' goals, and when: 
2. we accomplish them!

You get high setting yourself personal targets, but you lose that feeling when you don't accomplish them.
 
Make goals centred around mastery and long-term growth.
Attach emotion to the goal, add stakes and make it painful to fail.
 
Small Chunk:
- break down into 1 - 3 tasks for the day (don't push more)
- add emotional triggers for state to these tasks
 
### üß† Triggers Pt 3: Immediate Feedback
 
Identify methods of immediate feedback;
eg.
- replicate what you've learnt fast, test yourself
- build something (a product) with the knowlage you've gained
 
This is easy with coding because you'll get an error message.
With language learning, speaking what you've learnt is quick feedback.
 
With slower projects, find ways to feedback to yourself so you don't allow doubt or distraction to set in,

Find [[mentorship\|mentorship]] in anything you do seriously. 
You want to reduce the time between action and feedback. 

==Feedback loops should be your mission! ==

### üß† Triggers Pt 4: Challenge-to-Skill ratio
 [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/challenge-to-skill balance\|challenge-to-skill balance]] 
You want to frame what you're working on in terms of the skills you currently have.
"easy to do, easy not to do"
 
Break things into chunks that will be <5% higher challenge than your skill level.
 
 
### üß† Triggers Pt 5: High Consequences:
 
==High risk = high reward==
High risk releases adrenaline, dopamine and cortisol.
 
Take responsibility for things. (at work, in life)
Make a public statement and add stakes (think: Stikk)
 
 
### üß† Triggers Pt 6: Rich Environment:
 
Sensory overload leads to state.
eg.
White water rafting
The subconscious kicks in
 
But, this can be detrimental for a sole focus, academic learning.
 
### üß† Triggers Pt 7: Deep Embodiment
 
Awareness of your environment and the state around you.
Explore the site around you.
 
### üß† Trigger Pt 8: Serious Concentration
 
Full attention
Total presence in any situation.
When in a situation - be present. Give anything your all.
 
### üß† Trigger Pt 9: Shared and Clear Goals
 
Think: values and principles
A clear vision for the company.
 
### üß† Trigger Pt 10: Communication
 
You need clear flow of communication.
Positive and constructive feedback loops
Trust and time.
 
 
### üß† Trigger Pt 11: Familiarity

[[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Flow State and Triggers Resources\|Flow State and Triggers Resources]]

 
### üß† Trigger Pt 16: "Yes, and..."
 
Build on ideas or suggestions with "yes, and.."
Make jokes and light situations this way.
 
 
### üß† Trigger Pt 18: Music
 
Tag music onto your process eg. [brain.fm](http://brain.fm/)
Rotate playlists and variety
No lyrics or distractions

 
üß† Optimise your Flow Triggers:
- The more you enter flow, the easier the struggle will become
- Forgive yourself when you fail to surpass the struggle phase
- Reward yourself for overcoming the 'struggle' (chocolate, small treats)

# Additional Notes: 

## üåö Distraction:
[Surf the urge](https://youtu.be/m-OomGSciTY)
[[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Distraction MOC\|distraction]] 
The opposite of "dis-traction", is not 'focus' but; 'traction' (to move)
 
The two things that move us/ give us traction are; 'internal triggers' and 'external triggers'
 
Emotions/ resistance/ 'struggle phase' come like waves.
When you feel them:
- Surf the wave! 10 min sit down and HRV
- Give yourself love, be curious about the sensations
- Feel gratitude to be alive
 
Say: "I can have that distraction, but in 10 mins"

üò´ Avoid distractions at all costs!
‚è± Time = üíµ Money = üß¨ Life

## üõ† Key Tools:
1. **Time tracking** tools

	2. [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Time tracking apps\|time trackers]]
2. **Supplements**

## üèï The Flow Cycle in Daily Life:
 
- Embrace the struggle phase, learn to accept and welcome it!
This is where all goals go to die.
Make struggle tasks small, easy to execute and within your skill level.
 
üìù Plan and prepare: (mise-en-place)
- Use HRV for resonance and steady state.
- Use 80:20 rule
- Use Parkinson's law
- Use an Eisenhauer matrix
- Use fear setting

 
## How to Practice:
 [[Morgan's Brain/Maps of content MOCs/Learning how to learn MOC#Tactics\|Learning tactics]] 
- Practice retrieving information you've learned (think: recall and prompt cards) [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Blurting Method\|Blurting Method]]
- Space your practice throughout the day/week (rest and recovery time between sessions accelerate the learning process)
- Test yourself frequently during practice (make up tests or questions to ask yourself later)
- Vary your practice, but keep consistent. (Long-term, it's better than getting really good at just one thing)
- Ask 'why?' more than 'what'
 
Most of our intuition about studying and learning is wrong. There's lots of habits that are counter-intuitive. But work. Trust the process.

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Flow in working out / exercise: üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
 
Reminder: 
Flow is where the level of challenge, meets the level of skill.
 
- You want exercise to be pleasurable, in flow.
- You want your skill level to meet the challenge level.
 
You don't want to be in a state of anxiety!
(that's why you fail to go training, you don't want to do it again)
 
eg
If I can do 10 pull-ups max reps. - should you?
 
Take 2 people, person (a) and person (b):
Both can do 10 pullups max.
(a) does 10 reps in one day, kills himself and is sore for the next 3 days.
(b) does 5 reps, feels good.
 
(a) has to rest, doesn't get up early the next 2 days and feels anxiety and pain when thinking about training.
(b) is in the gym the next day. Does 5 more reps.
 
3 days later, (a) has only done 10 reps. In 1 day.
(b) has done 20 reps.
Who's training better??
 
Over the long term:
==‚è≥‚è≥ Consistency BEATS intensity! ü•µ==
