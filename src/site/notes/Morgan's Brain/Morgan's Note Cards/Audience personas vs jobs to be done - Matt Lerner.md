source:: [I wasted $1M on personas (Matt Lerner)](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/matthewlerner_i-once-wasted-1m-on-personas-matt-lerner-activity-7037014334195032064-mra-?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

At PayPal, I once wasted $1M on a marketing segmentation to build personas.  
Here’s what we actually learned, plus what I now do instead:
  
First of all, the research was exquisite. IPSOS started with dozens of interviews, then fielded thousands of surveys and clustered their findings into a segmentation.  
  
It teased out nuances among our merchant segments: eBay sellers, DtC, multi-channel, etc. Each persona had psychometric scores for risk tolerance, price sensitivity, ambition, tech savvy, etc.  
  
Eventually I asked myself *“how will this help our marketing?”*  

And, I realized it never would.  
  
These differences were fascinating but inconsequential. 
In payments, merchants basically all want the same 6 things:  
1. Buyers trust it  
2. Makes checkout easy  
3. Works with merchants' existing systems  
4. Isn't too expensive  
5. Helps manage fraud  
6. Good customer service  
  
You don’t need to be a PayPal expert to know that, and I definitely didn’t need to spend $1M to figure it out! But here’s my real lesson…  
  
Personas, even well-researched ones, are worthless for marketing.  
  
Try this thought experiment...  
  
Imagine you own a beachside restaurant and you’re trying to get more customers. Which one of these facts is more useful to you?  
  
1) Tammy is a 39 y/o divorced mother of 2, from Atlanta, she works in compliance, earns $58K/yr, throws right, votes left.  
  
2) Tammy is on the sweltering hot beach with two kids, they’re getting hungry, and one of them has to pee.  
  
**Option 2 wins**, it tells us that ice-cold air con and a no-fuss kids menu will draw Tammy in, where #1 leaves us guessing.  
  
### As a marketer, I need to understand 5 things:  
1) **What do prospects stress about?** 
   So I can play up that pain in ads & headlines. (It usually converts better than talking about the product.)  
  
2) **Where do they look for solutions?** 
   So I can turn up there (e.g. good search terms, complementary services that can send referrals).  
  
3) **Which alternatives did they try and how did those come up short?** 
   So I can position against them.  
  
4) **How do they describe success?** 
   So I can write a great landing page!  
  
5) **What are they nervous about?** 
   So I can call out and address each objection on my landing page and in my nurture emails. How do I get those 5 answers? (For a lot less than $1M?)  
  
Eventually, I discovered ==Jobs To Be Done==. And here’s how I use it specifically for marketing. [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Jobs to be done canvas - Matt Lerner\|Jobs to be done canvas - Matt Lerner]]

First, I interview people who recently signed up for my service or a competitor and ask questions like:   
1. What were you hoping to do?  
2. Why is that important to you?  
3. Where did you look?  
4. What else did you try?  
  
Instead of personas, I fill out a “Job Card” for each use case.
