The 3 to 1 Method takes advantage of the conditioned responses that you developed in the [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Silva Centering Method Video\|Silva Centering Exercise]]  

### Steps cheat sheet
1. sit comfortably in a meditative position 
2. close your eyes
3. breathe deeply and fully 
4. at a slow pace: 
5. repeat: and *visualise*:
	1. the number 3 - 3x times 
	2. the number 2 - 3x times
	3. the number 1 - 3x times
		1. 3) physical, 
		2. 2) mental, 
		3. 1) your 'level 1' centred state.

Combine this with my [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Transendental meditation (TM)\|Transendental meditation (TM)]] mantra: "Shring" to deepen the effect.

### Method
#### 1 
Find a comfortable position, 
close your eyes, *take a deep breath*, 
and mentally repeat, 
at a slow pace,
and ==*visualise* the number 3, three times. ==

You have already associated the number 3 with ==physical relaxation==, so your body will relax when you do this. 

#### 2
Take another *deep breath* 
and **while exhaling, 
mentally repeat** 
at a slow pace,
and ==*visualise* the number 2, three times. ==

In the Silva Centering Exercise, you related the number 2 to ==mental relaxation==. 

When you relax physically and mentally, your brain frequency will lower to the alpha level. 

#### 3
Take another *deep breath, 
and while exhaling, 
mentally repeat* 
and 
==visualise the number 1, three times ==

You are at **level 1, the alpha level**, which is at the ==centre of the brain frequency spectrum==, and functions at the midbrain area, in the centre of your brain. 

==**We will call this your centre.** ==
