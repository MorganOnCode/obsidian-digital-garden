## Idea
### Scratch your own itch 

Ideas are like elbows, everyone has them. 
Content ideas are gold. 
Cultivate a great idea generating process (like my morning notes)

Share and spread ideas, they won't be stolen. 
And, any copycats will have their own execution, their own niche. 

> [!todo]+ 
> *Create an ideas process (in daily notes) - keep them flowing!* 
> Get good at identifying and approaching potential problems. 
> Solving them and validating them are next. 
### build fast 

There are many no code tools to build what you want, and fast. 

The enemy is perfectionism. 

==Being comfortable with imperfect is a skill to develop. ==
In life and business. 
Let things be messy. 
You can fix them later. 

The lean startup way is best for software. 
Get something into the hands of users and get immediate feedback. 

Build a good MVP 
It must be good enough to function and look smart.
Have standards, don't ship shit. 
But - be aware of perfectionist delays based on zero feedback. 

### VC vs. Bootstrap
- bootstrap validates revenue from the start 
- bootstrap keeps costs low, and enforces good practices and behaviours
- you'll learn loads while building (vs. delegating skills to a team)

## Build
### Learn to code
Or at least, learn what's required in the structure of code. 
Learn the frameworks and best practices to pick things up quickly! 
The world is now owned by software devs! 
Use AI to your benefit
These skills will last a lifetime

Revisit [[Morgan's Brain/People/Michael Taylor\|Mike]]'s guides, [[Morgan's Brain/People/Shawn Wang\|Shawn Wang]] guides etc. 
Build solid prompt structures for GPTs and understand good vs. bad code. 

[[Morgan's Brain/People/Pieter Levels\|Levelsio]] recommends learning the hard way: brute forcing your knowledge and memory by solving problems the hard way. 
I don't like this. 
I think Mentors can help, accountability coaches can help. 
Reaching out to open source coders to share knowledge and ask VERY good and well framed questions can help you learn faster. 
Everything is in execution. 

Forget the argument about "which coding language" - its noise!
They all have strengths and weaknesses - learn to navigate them and build, build build! 

### Code structure
1. front-end (client)
2. backend (server)
3. databases 
	1. eg SQLite 

Be careful about tool selection and switching. 
As you've found: often its the processes/ mental models and systems that slow you down, not the magic silver bullet tool that fixes all your problems! 
The tool is only as good as the user (garbage in, garbage out - GIGO)

### Constraints 
#### no money
no initial injection, but you get 100% ownership! 
freedom

(also, you have money - and, probably always will)

#### no coding skills (yet)
Use no-code tools 
pay a freelancer to outline 'how' to build something
get a mentor 

#### no connections/ network 
be indie, be the underdog, be ignorant 
ask lots of questions, good questions that are well positioned. 
Tim Ferriss got reporters/authors drunk and SXSW and asked Qs 

##### Reach out to people:
- GitHub people making Obisidian apps 
- Obsidian influencers 
- indie hackers 
- go to meetups and build relationships 
- nurture existing relationships with good context + Q 
	- eg: "i read this and therefore I want to ask you..."
	- " I did this, but ... , therefore... (Q?)"
	- think about storytelling when communicating, 
		- [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/five W's\|5 Ws]] 
		- [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Storytelling - Then, But and Therefore\|Storytelling - Then, But and Therefore]]
### no code
#### website building
Squarespace, Carrd, Tilda, Wix
AI tools; Durable and Butternut 
#### APIs 
use them! 

> [!todo]+ Homework
> 
> Rank the list of ideas you made previously by which you think are best. 
> 
> Now see which of those best ideas you can execute quickest with the tools and skillset you already have right now â€” that means without learning anything else now. 
> 
> Build the first prototype of your idea, it's minimal, but that doesn't mean not functional. It should do something, either it being a Typeform connected to Zapier or a WordPress landing page or your self- programmed web app or native app. It should have the core functionality working well to be useful for users.

## Launch
The most important part of an MVP - feedback and validation! 

### staying motivated, energise and focused
be careful of dropping things too early - you need to ship, celebrate and reach completion. 
be careful of [[ADHD strategy ðŸ§  - MOC\|ADHD]] symptoms and look after yourself! 

But, if something isn't energising you for months (eg. my time at [[Morgan's Brain/Maps of content MOCs/Input Output MOC\|IOG]] )
It's time to focus energy on something else, or cut and move on. 
If you built something, sell it! 

> [!todo]+ Homework
> Make a list of places you will launch your first product, these can be the typical ones like Product Hunt, Hacker News and Reddit, but make sure there's more niche platforms on there too. 
> 
> Write a title and description for each platform you will launch too. Personalize it for each platform depending on its audience. Make sure it doesn't look spammy. 
> 
> Do a final check that your product actually works. Can a new user immediately see what it is about and start using it? Go through the process multiple times to make sure every little bug is gone. 
> 
> Pick a day and time and launch!
