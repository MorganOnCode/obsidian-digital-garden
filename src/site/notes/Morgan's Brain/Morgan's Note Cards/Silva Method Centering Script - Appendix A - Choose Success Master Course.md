The Silva Centering Exercise helps you discover an inner dimension, a dimension that you can use to become healthier, luckier, and more successful in achieving your goals. When you learn to function from this inner dimension, you automatically become more spiritual, more human, healthier, safer from accidents, and a more successful problem solver. 

In order for you to use this inner dimension, you need to hear the Silva Centering Exercise for a total of ten hours and to follow the simple directions in the mind exercise. 

**How to Read the Silva Centering Exercise** 
When reading the Silva Centering Exercise, read in a relaxed, natural voice. Be close enough so that the listener can hear you comfortably. Read loud enough to be heard, and read as though you were reading to a seven-year-old child. Speak each word clearly and distinctly. Have the listener assume a comfortable position. A sitting position is preferred, but the most important thing is to make sure that the listener is comfortable. If uncomfortable, the listener will not relax as much and will not get as much benefit from the exercise. Avoid distractions, such as loud outside noises. There should be enough light so you can read comfortably but no extremely bright lights. If the person shows any signs of nervousness or appears to be uncomfortable, stop reading, tell them to relax and make themselves comfortable. When they are comfortable and ready, then continue. Take your time when you read; there is no need to rush. Note: Do not read the headings (in bold print) or the words in parentheses. They are for your information. 

**Deepening (Physical Relaxation at Level 3)** 
Find a comfortable position, close your eyes, take a deep breath, and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize number 3 three times. (pause) 
To help you learn to relax physically at level 3, I am going to direct your attention to different parts of your body. Concentrate your sense of awareness on your scalp, the skin that covers your head; you will detect a fine vibration, a tingling sensation, a feeling of warmth caused by circulation. (pause) 
Now release and completely relax all tensions and ligament pressures from this part of your head, and place it in a deep state of relaxation that will grow deeper as we continue. (pause)

Concentrate your sense of awareness on your forehead, the skin that covers your forehead; you will detect a fine vibration, a tingling sensation, a feeling of warmth caused by circulation. (pause)

Now release and completely relax all tensions and ligament pressures from this part of your body, and place it in a deep state of relaxation that will grow deeper as we continue. (pause) 
Concentrate within the throat area, and relax all tensions and ligament pressures from this part of your body, and place it in a deep state of relaxation, going deeper and deeper every time. (pause)

(pause) Concentrate on your knees; feel the skin and the vibration of your skin covering the knees. (pause) Relax all tensions and ligament pressures, and place your knees in a deep state of relaxation, going deeper and deeper every time. (pause)

To enter a deeper, healthier level of mind, concentrate on your toes . (pause) Enter a deeper, healthier level of mind. To enter a deeper, healthier level of mind, concentrate on the soles of your feet. (pause) Enter a deeper, healthier level of mind. (pause)

(pause) Your feet, ankles, calves, knees, thighs, waist, shoulders, arms, and hands feel as though they do not belong to your body. (pause) 
You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind, deeper than before. This is your physical relaxation level 3. Whenever you mentally repeat and visualize the number 3, your body will relax as completely as you are now, and more so every time you practice.

**Deepening (Mental Relaxation at Level 2)** 
To enter the mental relaxation level 2, mentally repeat and visualize the number 2 several times, and you are at level 2, a deeper level than 3. (pause) Level 2 is for mental relaxation, where noises will not distract you. Instead, noises will help you to relax mentally more and more. To help you learn to relax mentally at level 2, I am going to call your attention to different passive scenes. Visualizing any scene that makes you tranquil and passive will help you relax mentally. Your being at the beach on a nice summer day may be a tranquil and passive scene for you. (pause) A day out fishing may be a tranquil and passive scene for you. (pause)

A tranquil and passive scene for you may be a walk through the woods on a beautiful summer day, when the breeze is just right, where there are tall shade trees, beautiful flowers, a very blue sky, an occasional white cloud, birds singing in the distance, even squirrels playing on the tree limbs. Hear birds singing in the distance. (pause) This is mental relaxation level 2, where noises will not distract you. To enhance mental relaxation at level 2, practice visualizing tranquil and passive scenes. 

**To Enter Your Center** 
To enter level 1, mentally repeat and visualize the number 1 several times. (pause) You are now at level 1, the basic level, where you can function from your center. 

**Deepening Exercises** 
To enter deeper, healthier levels of mind, practice with the countdown deepening exercises. To deepen, count downward from 25 to 1, or from 50 to 1, or from 100 to 1. When you reach the count of 1, you will have reached a deeper, healthier level of mind, deeper than before. You will always have full control and complete dominion over your faculties and senses at all levels of the mind, including the outer, conscious level. 

**When to Practice** 
The best time to practice the countdown deepening exercises is in the morning when you wake up. Remain in bed at least five minutes practicing the countdown deepening exercises. The second best time to practice is at night, when you are ready to retire. The third best time to practice is at noon after lunch. Five minutes of practice is good, ten minutes is very good, and fifteen minutes is excellent. To practice once a day is good, two times a day is very good, and three times a day is excellent. If you have a health problem, practice for fifteen minutes, three times a day. 

**To Come out of Levels** 
To come out of any level of the mind, count to yourself mentally from 1 to 5, and tell yourself that at the count of 5, you will open your eyes, be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before. Then proceed to count slowly from 1 to 2, then to 3, and at the count of 3, mentally remind yourself that at the count of 5 you will open your eyes, be wide awake, feeling fine and in prefect health, feeling better than before. Proceed to count slowly to 4, then to 5. At the count of 5 and with your eyes open, mentally tell yourself, “I am wide awake, feeling fine, and in perfect health, feeling better than before. And this is so.” 

**Deepening (Routine Cycle)** 
To help you enter a deeper, healthier level of mind, I am going to count from 10 to 1. On each descending number, you will feel yourself going deeper, and you will enter a deeper, healthier level of mind. 10—9, feel going deeper, 8—7—6, deeper and deeper, 5—4—3, deeper and deeper, 2—1 You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind, deeper than before. You may enter a deeper, healthier level of mind by simply relaxing your eyelids. Relax your eyelids. (pause) Feel how relaxed they are. (pause) Allow this feeling of relaxation to flow slowly downward throughout your body all the way down to your toes. (pause) It is a wonderful feeling to be deeply relaxed, a very healthy state of being. To help you enter a deeper, healthier level of mind, I am going to count from 1 to 3. At that moment, you will project yourself mentally to your ideal place of relaxation. I will then stop talking to you, and when you next hear my voice, one hour of time will have elapsed at this level of mind. My voice will not startle you; you will take a deep breath, relax, and go deeper. 1—(pause)—2—(pause)—3. Project yourself mentally to your ideal place of relaxation until you hear my voice again. Relax. (Reader: remain silent for about thirty seconds.) Relax. (pause) Take a deep breath, and as you exhale, relax and go deeper. (pause)

**Rapport** 
You will continue to listen to my voice; you will continue to follow the instructions at this level of the mind and any other level, including the outer conscious level. This is for your benefit; you desire it, and it is so. Whenever you hear me mention the word “Relax,” all unnecessary movements and activities of your body, brain, and mind will cease immediately, and you will become completely passive and relaxed physically and mentally. I may bring you out of this level or a deeper level than this by counting to you from 1 to 5. At the count of 5, your eyes will open; you will be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health. I may bring you out of this level or a deeper level than this by touching your left shoulder three times. When you feel my hand touch your left shoulder for the third time, your eyes will open; you will be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health. And this is so. 

**Genius Statements** 
The difference between genius mentality and lay mentality is that geniuses use more of their minds and use them in a special manner. You are now learning to use more of your mind and to use it in a special manner. 

**Beneficial Statements** 
The following are beneficial statements that you may occasionally repeat while at these levels of the mind. Repeat mentally after me. (Reader: read slowly): My increasing mental faculties are for serving humanity better. Every day, in every way, I am getting better, better, and better. Positive thoughts bring me benefits and advantages I desire. I have full control and complete dominion over my sensing faculties at this level of the mind and any other level, including the outer conscious level. And this is so. I will always maintain a perfectly healthy body and mind. 

**Effective Sensory Projection Statements for Success Effective** 
Sensory Projection statements for success. I am now learning to attune my intelligence by developing my sensing faculties and to project them to any problem area so as to be aware of any actions taking place, if this is necessary and beneficial for humanity. I am now learning to correct any problems I detect. Negative thoughts and negative suggestions have no influence over me at any level of the mind. 

**Post Effects: Preview of Next Session** 
You have practiced entering deep, healthy levels of mind. In your next session, you will enter a deeper, healthier level of mind, faster and easier than this time. 

**Post Effects: Standard** 
Every time you function at these levels of the mind, you will receive beneficial effects physically and mentally. You may use these levels of the mind to help yourself physically and mentally. You may use these levels of the mind to help your loved ones, physically and mentally. You may use these levels of the mind to help any human being who needs help, physically and mentally. You will never use these levels of the mind to harm any human being; if this be your intention, you will not be able to function within these levels of the mind. You will always use these levels of the mind in a constructive, creative manner for all that is good, honest, pure, clean, and positive. And this is so. You will continue to strive to take part in constructive and creative activities to make this a better world to live in, so that when we move on, we shall have left behind a better world for those who follow. You will consider the whole of humanity, depending on their ages, as fathers or mothers, brothers or sisters, sons or daughters. You are a superior human being; you have greater understanding, compassion, and patience with others. 

**Bring Out**
In a moment, I am going to count from 1 to 5. 
At that moment, you will open your eyes, be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before. You will have no ill effects what-soever in your head, no headache; no ill effects whatsoever in your hearing, no buzzing in your ears; no ill effects whatsoever in your vision and eyesight; vision, eyesight, and hearing improve every time you function at these levels of mind. 
1-2, coming out slowly now. 
3, at the count of 5, you will open your eyes, be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before, feeling the way you feel when you have slept the right amount of revitalizing, refreshing, relaxing, healthy sleep. 
4-5. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before. (Reader: Be sure to observe whether or not the person is wide awake. 
If in doubt, touch the person’s left shoulder three times and while doing so, say: “Wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health. And this is so.” 

It is recommended that everyone practice staying at your center for fifteen minutes a day to normalize all abnormal conditions of the body and mind.
