## Steps
### Step 1: Find an idea with unmet demand
**Find the idea** 
- [[Morgan's Brain/Maps of content MOCs/Business Ideas MOC ðŸ’¡\|business ideas]]
- [[Ahrefs\|Ahrefs]] - search volumes 
- Trends apps 

### Step 2: estimate market size & value
**Estimate [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/total accessible market (TAM)\|total accessible market (TAM)]]** 
- Use [CrunchBase](https://www.crunchbase.com/#/home/index) to research the business you want to replicate
- Assess the value of the customer, based on how much they already spend - initial costs, maintenance costs, etc
- Use the

> TAM = (Number of available customers) x (Value of each customer)

# Process: 5-minute business model:
Is this a $1 million opportunity?
1. ==Is the industry growing, or shrinking?== - Google Search Trends
2. ==Identify est. audience size== - Google Trends, Ahrefs, Ads Marketplaces
3. ==Cost of product== - what can you reasonably sell?
4. ==Can I make $1 million or more?==

## Can I increase revenue? 

1. **Average order value**: Increase the amount someone purchases.
2. **Frequency**: Increase how often someone will buy your service.
3. **Price point**: Increase or decrease your price point to affect total sales.
4. **Customer type**: Approach a more lucrative/wealthier customer segment.
5. **Product line**: Add additional products to make the business more attractive to start.
6. **Add-on services**: If youâ€™re selling a product like cookies, can you offer a service like setting up birthday parties or cooking at the personâ€™s home?
7. **Bundling**: Can I package several products, or create a directory (like Microsoft 365 suite) to sell at a higher price point?


> [!gpt]- TAM Calculation methods: 
> - **Top-Down**: 
> 	- Uses industry data and reports to estimate the TAM. It's a quicker method but can be less accurate as it relies on broad market data.
> 	- Apply industry averages and market research data to the broader market size. This might involve taking a percentage of a known larger market based on the segment your product or service targets.
> - **Bottom-Up**: 
> 	- Uses actual data from initial sales or a detailed analysis of potential sales volumes and prices. It's more accurate but requires more detailed data.
> 	- Multiply the number of potential customers by the average revenue per user (ARPU). This method gives a more direct estimate based on actual sales data or realistic sales projections.
> - **Value-Theory**: 
> 	- Estimates TAM based on the value or outcome the product or service provides to customers. This method is useful for innovative products without existing market data.
> 	- Estimate the economic or value impact of your solution on the market and what portion of this value your business can capture.

### Step 3: experiment with marketing to customers 
**Experiment**
- speak to mentors (like [[Morgan's Brain/People/Positive John Ostrowski\|PJ]])
- TEST all assumptions
- Ask people to convert (sign up -> buy)
- Try [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/do things that don't scale\|doing things that don't scale]] 

**What does success look like?**
- Set a target sales benchmark based on your 
	- Â£cost/time number i.e. Â£100/hour = X sales/hour
- [Stress Test sales strategy](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/03/04/5-million-week/) (Ramit)
- Create a one page Sales Page (landing page) - Use wordpress or Unbounce. 
	- [Sales page](http://chrisbrogan.com/the-new-sales-page/)
	- [Original Mint.com page](http://okdork.com/mint/?i=1)


- Use tools
- Exclude/ say no more than you say yes - you must be exceptional to succeed at this
