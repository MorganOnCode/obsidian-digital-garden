> **Gamma** is when driving a car at speed, operating in a high paced sport (Fencing). High stress, automated sub-conscious motor functions happen here.
> **Beta** is normal wakefulness, ignorant operation and letting your environment have its effect on you. 
> **Alpha** is the optimal space. And, getting into & out of Alpha is what [[Morgan's Brain/People/Josh Waitzkin\|Josh Waitzkin]] talks about in [[Markdown Mind Maps Ethan Schwandt/The Art of Learning - Josh Waitzkin\|The Art of Learning - Josh Waitzkin]] - calm confidence, into explosive brutality. The signature of a master. 
> **Theata** is light sleep. [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/non sleep deep rest (NSDR)\|non sleep deep rest (NSDR)]] is what [[Morgan's Brain/People/Andrew Huberman\|Andrew Huberman]] talks about for mental recovery and focus. 
> Finally, **Delta** is deep sleep. [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Oura ring\|Oura ring]] should track this.

## Alpha state
There are different states and frequencies of operation for the brain. 
==Alpha is around 7 to 14 hz.==
In this relaxed, [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Flow State and Triggers\|Flow state]], you can access deep work and concentration levels. 

[[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/visualisation\|visualisation]] happens in Alpha state. 

[[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Heart Rate Variability (HRV)\|Heart Rate Variability (HRV)]] training and meditation [[Morgan's Brain/Morgan's Note Cards/Waking Up\|Waking Up]] helps your body and brain pass through alpha. 

The more you can access that state and operate from a place of calm, collected confidence, the more you can pivot any anxiety or fears to action and resourceful conviction.
