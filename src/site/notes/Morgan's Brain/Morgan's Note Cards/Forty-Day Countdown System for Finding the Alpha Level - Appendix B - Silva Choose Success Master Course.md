**Forty-Day Countdown System for Finding the Alpha Level** 
This is an alternate way to find the alpha level. 
You can use this instead of the Silva Centering Exercise if you prefer. 
This is a simple way to relax, and you will do better and better at this as you practice. 

You can also use a beneficial statement to help you. This is how you train your mind. 
You relax, lower your brain frequency to the alpha level, and practice using imagination and visualisation. Read the instructions first so that you can put the book down, close your eyes, and follow them. 

**Here they are:** 
1. Sit comfortably in a chair, and close your eyes. 
   Any position that is comfortable is a good position. 
2. Take a deep breath, and as you exhale, relax your body. 
3. *Count backward slowly from 50 to 1.* 
4. Daydream about some peaceful place you know. 
5. Say to yourself mentally, “Every day, in every way, I am getting better, better, and better.” 
6. Remind yourself mentally that when you open your eyes at the count of five, you will feel wide awake, better than before. 

When you reach the count of 3, repeat this, and when you open your eyes, repeat it 
“I am wide awake, feeling better than before”. 

You already know steps one and two. You do them daily when you get home in the evening. Add a countdown, a peaceful scene, and a beneficial statement to help you become better and better, and you are ready for a final count-out. Read the instructions once more. 
==Then put the book down and do it.==

**Learning to Function Consciously at the Alpha Level** 
As stated previously, you learn to enter the alpha level and function there with just one day of training when you attend the Silva UltraMind ESP Systems live training programs. 

> [!note]- Audio recordings and notes on how to use this: 
> You can use audio recordings to learn to enter the alpha level within a few days with either a Silva home study program or the free lessons at the SilvaESP.com/csv/ website. 
> You can also ==record the Silva Centering Exercise in appendix A and listen to it==, or have someone read it to you. 
> 
> If you have already learned to enter the alpha level by one of those methods, you can skip the following instructions for practicing countdown deepening exercises for the next forty days. If not, then follow these instructions from José Silva: When you enter sleep, you enter alpha. But you quickly go right through alpha to the deeper levels of theta and delta. Throughout the night, your brain moves back and forth through alpha, theta, and delta, like the ebb and flow of the tide. These cycles last about ninety minutes. In the morning, as you exit sleep, you come out through alpha back into the faster beta frequencies that are associated with the outer conscious levels. Some authors advise that as you go to sleep at night, you think about your goals. That way, you get a little bit of alpha time for programming. The only trouble is, you have a tendency to fall asleep. For now, I just want you to practice a simple exercise that will help you learn to enter and stay at the alpha level. Then, in forty days, you will be ready to begin your programming. In the meantime, I will give you some additional tasks that you can perform at the beta level that will help you prepare yourself so that you will be able to program more effectively at the alpha level when you are ready at the completion of the forty days.

> If you are using the Silva Centering Exercise on the SilvaESP.com/csv/ website to enter the alpha level, you can skip the information that follows. If you do not want to use the recording of the Silva Centering Exercise, or record it yourself from the script in appendix A, and you have not attended a Silva seminar or used one of our home study courses to learn to enter the alpha level, then you will need to follow the instructions here to learn to enter the alpha level on your own. 

**Here is your alpha exercise:** 
Practice this exercise in the morning when you first wake up. Since your brain is starting to shift from alpha to beta when you first wake up, you will not have a tendency to fall asleep when you enter alpha. 

**Here are the steps to take:** 
1. When you awake tomorrow morning, go to the bathroom if you have to, then go back to bed. Set your alarm clock to ring in fifteen minutes, just in case you do fall asleep again. 
2. Close your eyes, and turn them slightly upward toward your eyebrows (about 20 degrees). Research shows that this produces more alpha brain wave activity. 
3. *Count backward slowly from 100 to 1.* Do this silently; that is, do it mentally to yourself. Wait about one second between numbers. 
4. When you reach the count of one, hold a mental picture of yourself as a success. An easy way to do this is to recall the most recent time when you were 100 percent successful. Recall the setting, where you were, and what the scene looked like; recall what you did; and recall what you felt like. 
5. Repeat mentally, “Every day in every way I am getting better, better, and better.” 
6. Then say to yourself, “I am going to count from 1 to 5; when I reach the count of 5, I will open my eyes, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before.” 
7. Begin to count. When you reach 3, repeat, “When I reach the count of 5, I will open my eyes, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before.” 
8. Continue your count to 4 and 5. At the count of 5, open your eyes and tell yourself mentally, “I am wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before. And this is so.” 

**These Eight Steps Are Really Only Three** 
Go over each of these eight steps so that you understand the purpose, and at the same time you become more familiar with the sequence. 

1. The mind cannot relax deeply if the body is not relaxed. It is better to go to the bathroom and permit your body to enjoy full comfort. Also, when you first awake, you may not be fully awake. Going to the bathroom ensures your being fully awake. But in case you are still not awake enough to stay awake, set your alarm clock to ring in fifteen minutes, so you do not risk being late on your daily schedule. Sit in a comfortable position. 
2. Research has shown that when a person turns the eyes up about 20 degrees, it triggers more alpha rhythm in the brain and also causes more right-brain activity. Later, when we do our mental picturing, it will be with your eyes turned upward at this angle. Meanwhile, it is a simple way to encourage alpha brain wave activity. You might want to think of the way you look up at the screen in a movie theater: a comfortable upward angle. 
3. Counting backward is relaxing. Counting forward is activating. 1-2-3 is like “get ready, get set, go!” 3-2-1 is pacifying. You are going nowhere except deeper within yourself. 
4. Imagining yourself the way you want to be—while relaxed—creates the picture. Failures who relax and imagine themselves making mistakes and losing frequently create a mental picture that brings about failure. You will do the opposite. Your mental picture is one of success, and it will create what you desire: success. 
5. Words repeated mentally—while relaxed—create the concepts they stand for. Pictures and words program the mind to make it so.   
6.  6 to 8. These last three steps are simply counting to 5 to end your session. Counting upward activates you, but it’s still good to give yourself “orders” to become activated at the count of 5. Do this before you begin to count; do it again along the way; and again as you open your eyes. 

Once you wake up tomorrow morning and prepare yourself for this exercise, it all works down to three steps: Count backward from 100 to 1.

Imagine yourself successful. Count yourself out 1 to 5, reminding yourself that you are wide awake, feeling fine, and in perfect health. 

**Forty Days That Can Change Your Life—for the Better** 
You know what to do tomorrow morning, but what about after that? Here is your training program: 
Count backward from 100 to 1 for 10 mornings. 
Count backward from 50 to 1 for 10 mornings. 
Count backward from 25 to 1 for 10 mornings. 
Count backward from 10 to 1 for 10 mornings. 

After these 40 mornings of countdown relaxation practice, count backward only from 5 to 1, and begin to use your alpha level. 

People have a tendency to be impatient, to want to move faster. 
==Please resist this temptation, and follow the instructions as written.==
You must develop and acquire the ability to function consciously at alpha before the mental techniques will work properly for you. 
You must master the fundamentals first. 

We’ve been researching this field since 1944, longer than anyone else, and the techniques we have developed have helped millions of people worldwide to enjoy greater success and happiness, so please follow these simple instructions.
