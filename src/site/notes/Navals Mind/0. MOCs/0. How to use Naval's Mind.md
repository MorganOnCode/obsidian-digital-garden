*Note to Morgan*
These notes aren't like others in my PKM. 
They won't have YAML or tags, they're navigable via the folder structure and the MOC here: 

the audio files are contained on your NAS and on Google Drive and OneDrive as backups. 
when you see the episode number, simply find it in your storage. 
*they weren't attached here because they'll bloat Obsidian.*

You can find all the audio files as one long podcast here: 
[How to Get Rich without getting lucky - Naval - YouTube](https://youtu.be/1-TZqOsVCNM)
[How to Get Rich - Nav.al](https://nav.al/rich)
